## University Policies on Academic Integrity

Principles of academic integrity require that every Rutgers University student:

* properly acknowledge and cite all use of the ideas, results, or words of others
* properly acknowledge all contributors to a given piece of work
* make sure that all work submitted as his or her own in a course or other academic activity is produced without the aid of unsanctioned materials or unsanctioned collaboration
* obtain all data or results by ethical means and report them accurately without suppressing any results inconsistent with his or her * interpretation or conclusions
* treat all other students in an ethical manner, respecting their integrity and right to pursue their educational goals without interference. This requires that a student neither facilitate academic dishonesty by others nor obstruct their academic progress
* uphold the canons of the ethical or professional code of the profession for which he or she is preparing.

Adherence to these principles is necessary in order to insure that:

* everyone is given proper credit for his or her ideas, words, results, and other scholarly accomplishments
* all student work is fairly evaluated and no student has an inappropriate advantage over others
* the academic and ethical development of all students is fostered
* the reputation of the University for integrity in its teaching, research, and scholarship is maintained and enhanced.

Failure to uphold these principles of academic integrity threatens both the reputation of the University and the value of the degrees awarded to its students. Every member of the University community therefore bears a responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of academic integrity are upheld.

Infractions are not taken lightly and will fully be pursued. For additional information, visit http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/
